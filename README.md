# Todo App with Atlas UI

![CI Status](https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A React-based Todo application built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Atlas UI components. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with proper state management, component architecture, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- ✅ Mark todos as completed
- ✅ Session persistence using browser sessionStorage
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

## Session Persistence

The application automatically saves your todos to browser sessionStorage, ensuring they persist through page refreshes within the same browser session. Key features:

- **Automatic saving**: Todos are saved immediately when created, edited, or deleted
- **Session-only**: Data persists only during the current browser session
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles corrupt data and storage quota errors
- **User feedback**: Shows notifications if storage quota is exceeded
- **No external dependencies**: Uses native browser sessionStorage API

### Limitations

- Data is cleared when the browser session ends (closing all tabs)
- Storage is limited by browser quota (typically 5-10MB)
- Data is not shared between different browser tabs or devices
